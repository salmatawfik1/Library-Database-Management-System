# Library-Database-Management-System
A university project for database course where me and my teammates implemented:
- Conceptual & Physical ERD.
- SQL Database.
- An application program with C# that provides a GUI for interacting with the library databse, allowing insertion, deletion, updating data, selecting data from one or more tables.
